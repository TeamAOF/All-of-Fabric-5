			                      five hearts and in case it is higher it will loop back over first five health hearts.
			         Example 2: If a player has more than 20 absorption, second color is shown the same way as in "BEGINNING".
			         Example 3: If player health is divisible by 20, absorption is shown the same way as in "BEGINNING".
